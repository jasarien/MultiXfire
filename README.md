# MultiXfire
An Xfire relay server for OS X

An Xfire relay server developed for the purpose of providing Push Notification service to Xblaze (http://github.com/jasarien/Xblaze-iOS). It was never released to the public.  
It is no longer in active development, but is here for posterity and if anyone wants to contribute.
